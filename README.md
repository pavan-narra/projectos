I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO WORK ON API SO I DIDNOT CREATED ANY API.

MY WORK 

1)INSTALL AND IMPORT WIKIPEDIA 
INSTALLED TWO VERSIONS OF WIKIPEDIA API BUT USED LATEST VERSION
2014 VERSION IS LACKING IN SEARCH PARTICULARS.

2)SEARCH ANY THING FROM WIKIPEDIA 
WORK ON THE INFORMATION RETRIVED FROM SEARCH OPERATION.

WE CAN STORE THESE INFORMATION IN ANY CSV OR JSON FILES BUT I DIRECLY USED THE OUTPUT FOR DIRECT PROCESSING. (TEXT1)

FOR NER (NAME ENTITY RECOGNIZATION):
IMPORTED SPACY LIBRARY FOR NER AND PANDS FOR DATAFRAMES

APPROACHES:

I HAVE TRIED DIFFERNT ALGORTHIMS LIKE NTLK ALGORITHM 
NLP NER ALGORITHM BUT I DIDNT GET ANY EXPECTED RESULTS .

SO I USE SPACY ALGORITM WHICH GIVES EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS

SPACY IS THE BEST

TO IDENTIFY LABELS I USED .EXPLAIN SO THAT WE CAN KNOW WHAT TYPE OF LABEL IT IS.
